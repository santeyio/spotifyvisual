I have a webhook for this repo that signals my
[deployment server](https://github.com/santeyio/deployment-server)
to pull down the latest commit whenever it's pushed to this repo.
All that to say that link is always up to date with this repo.

# What is this?

It's a visualization of the lyrics from your spotify playlists
as bubble charts!

Pretty cool right? 

Currently under development using django and vue. I'm still
trying to figure out the best way to combine django as a 
backend with webpack running my frontend projects. It's an 
interesting challenge to pull together.
